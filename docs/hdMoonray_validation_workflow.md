# hdMoonray Validation Workflow

This workflow records the validation levels that actually caught or proved recent hdMoonray changes. Use it before promoting a feature from WIP to stable.

## Evidence-Gated Investigation Rules

Use these rules before planning, implementing, or promoting any Render Settings, AOV, viewport/IPR, render-buffer, or backend lifecycle change.

Every important claim must be classified as one of:

- `PROVEN`: backed by source path plus command/output, exported USD/RDLA, logs, render output, EXR stats, or installed-runtime proof.
- `OBSERVED`: directly seen in Houdini/runtime behavior, but not yet fully explained.
- `HYPOTHESIS`: plausible explanation with a named test that can prove or disprove it.
- `UNKNOWN`: not enough evidence yet.
- `OUT OF SCOPE`: intentionally not part of the current task.

Rules:

1. No claim without evidence.
2. No recommendation without a reproducer, source-path proof, exported USD proof, log proof, RDLA proof, render proof, or EXR proof.
3. Do not call a feature working because a UI folder, parameter, channel, RenderVar, or scene object exists.
4. A black render is a functional failure until render proof shows otherwise.
5. Authored USD alone is not render proof.
6. RDLA/RenderOutput declaration alone is not image-buffer proof.
7. Debug renderer success is not production renderer success.
8. Do not use Houdini 21 evidence to prove Houdini 20.5 behavior.
9. UI cleanup must not hide backend lifecycle, dirtying, render-buffer, AOV binding, or viewport/IPR refresh bugs.
10. Do not modify backend behavior without source-path proof, exported USD proof, log proof, and render/EXR or runtime symptom proof.
11. If evidence conflicts, report the conflict instead of choosing the convenient explanation.

Primary source-of-truth hierarchy:

1. Local runtime behavior in the target Houdini version, currently H20.5 for this work.
2. Exported USD from the exact scene state being tested.
3. Installed hdMoonray source and binaries currently loaded by Houdini.
4. MoonRay native metadata, especially `/Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/coredata/SceneVariables.json` and `/Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/coredata/RenderOutput.json`.
5. MoonRay docs and source.
6. OpenUSD RenderSettings/Product/Var schemas.
7. SideFX Houdini/HDK docs and local Houdini headers.
8. Local project docs and prior audit notes.

For every `PROVEN` claim, record the exact evidence: file path, function/class/name, commit hash if relevant, command run, output excerpt, exported USDA/RDLA path if relevant, and render/EXR proof if relevant.

For every `HYPOTHESIS`, record the exact test that would prove or disprove it.

## Validation Layers

| Layer | What it proves | Tools / evidence | Required for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source audit | The change maps to real code paths and native concepts. | `rg`, `git show`, local metadata, MoonRay/OpenUSD/SideFX docs | All changes |
| USD authoring | Houdini/Solaris authored the intended prims, attrs, rels, or custom properties. | `usdcat`, `usdview`, hython/HOM, exported USDA | UI, RenderSettings, lights, geometry |
| Hydra/hdMoonray translation | hdMoonray receives and translates the intended values. | source tracing, logs, debug fixtures, `hd_usd2rdl` if applicable | Backend changes |
| RDLA/RDL proof | MoonRay scene objects and attributes exist with expected values. | debug RDLA/RDL output, `rdlOutput`, renderer logs | Lights, geometry, render settings, AOV declarations |
| Render proof | The feature affects an actual render correctly. | husk, USD Render ROP, image output | Lights, materials, geometry, render settings |
| EXR/image stats | Pixels are filled and plausible. | `oiiotool --stats`, channel inspection | AOVs, render buffer work |
| Houdini UI proof | The installed UI behaves correctly without unlocking or hidden stale state. | H20.5 fresh session, HOM, screenshots where useful | DS/HDA/shelf work |
| Runtime provenance | The installed runtime loaded the rebuilt code. | shasum, `strings`, `otool`, branch/hash checks | Compiled code, diagnostics |

## Minimum Source Checks

Run these in the relevant repo before and after work:

```sh
git status --short
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git rev-parse HEAD
git diff --stat
git diff
```

For submodules, also check the parent:

```sh
git -C /Applications/MoonRay/source/openmoonray status --short
git -C /Applications/MoonRay/source/openmoonray diff --submodule
```

## Runtime Provenance Checks

Use these whenever compiled code or installed Houdini plugins are involved:

```sh
pwd -P
cmake --build /Applications/MoonRay/build --target <target> --config Release
shasum <build-artifact>
shasum <installed-artifact>
strings <installed-artifact> | rg "<temporary diagnostic marker>"
```

The AOV audit showed that stale installed dylibs can invalidate an otherwise careful investigation. Remove diagnostic strings and prove they are gone before final reporting.

For narrow hdMoonray testing, prefer rebuilding only the affected plugin targets
instead of running the full OpenMoonRay install target when unrelated MoonRay
core build issues would obscure the feature being validated:

```sh
cd /Applications/MoonRay/build
cmake --build . --target hydramoonray --config Release -j8
cmake --build . --target hd_moonray --config Release -j8
cmake --build . --target hdMoonrayAdapters --config Release -j8
```

Houdini loads hdMoonray from the installed package under
`/Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray`, not directly from the build tree.
Until the install workflow is made cleaner, manually copy the rebuilt dylibs
when validating this narrow path:

```sh
cp /Applications/MoonRay/build/moonray/hydra/hdMoonray/lib/hydramoonray/Release/libhydramoonray.dylib \
   /Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/lib/libhydramoonray.dylib

cp /Applications/MoonRay/build/moonray/hydra/hdMoonray/plugin/hd_moonray/Release/hd_moonray.dylib \
   /Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/plugin/hd_moonray.dylib

cp /Applications/MoonRay/build/moonray/hydra/hdMoonray/plugin/adapters/Release/hdMoonrayAdapters.dylib \
   /Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/plugin/hdMoonrayAdapters.dylib
```

This manual copy step is temporary testing workflow, not the desired long-term
install solution.

For Houdini DCC/DS work, also prove the installed package path. Source-path HOM
validation can find a new DS file that artists do not actually load. In the
native Camera controls pass, a source `HOUDINI_PATH` found
`moonray_Camera.ds`, but a normal H20.5 session loaded:

```text
/Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/plugin/houdini
```

and initially had no `moonray_Camera.ds`. The existing install step:

```sh
cmake -P /Applications/MoonRay/build/moonray/moonray_dcc_plugins/houdini/cmake_install.cmake
```

synced the source DS into the installed package. The final UI proof came from a
fresh normal H20.5 Camera LOP, not from the source-path check alone.

## Light Validation

For light work, validate each layer:

1. Export the Solaris-authored USD.
2. Confirm standard USD attributes are present and renderer-specific overrides are absent unless explicitly enabled.
3. Render or dump RDLA.
4. Confirm the RDL light class.
5. Confirm translated attributes.
6. Confirm no missing DSO errors.
7. Confirm live updates when the UI changes class-affecting state.

Stable examples:

- Default Sphere/Point intent no longer authors `moonray:class = PointLight`.
- Explicit `moonray:class = SpotLight` validates and creates MoonRay `SpotLight`.
- Invalid `moonray:class = PointLight` warns and falls back.
- RectLight plus ShapingAPI stays `RectLight` and maps to `spread`.
- DomeLight aliases map to `EnvLight`.

Special cases:

- SpotLight orientation and class swaps require render or transform/RDLA proof.
- SphereLight/DiskLight ShapingAPI behavior should be re-audited before broad policy changes.
- RectLight ShapingAPI should not become SpotLight unless the native override is explicit.

## Geometry / Subdivision Validation

For geometry settings:

1. Check USD topology/subdivision inputs.
2. Check `primvars:moonray:*` or namespaced attrs if used.
3. Confirm backend does not override explicitly authored primvars.
4. Dump RDLA and inspect mesh attributes.
5. Render a small fixture.

Stable evidence:

- `d85ec55` adds Mesh translation and a tracked fixture under `testSuite/geometry/moonray_geometry_settings`.
- `24bac7e` improves float conversion evidence for SceneVariables/geometry settings.
- `78ca757` exposes geometry controls in Houdini DS.

Avoid:

- Global render settings for prim-specific geometry behavior.
- Defaults that stomp authored primvars.

## Material Builder Validation

For material subnet work:

1. Create the tool in a fresh H20.5 session.
2. Confirm it creates a Houdini-native editable material subnet.
3. Confirm real MoonRay VOP nodes exist.
4. Confirm surface and displacement outputs are connected.
5. Render or generate a fixture through Solaris.

Stable evidence:

- `moonray_dcc_plugins` `952eea3` adds `moonray_material_builder.py` and shelf tool support.
- hdMoonray `77a673e` includes `generate_moonray_material_builder_fixture.py`.

Avoid:

- Fake material wrappers.
- Locked HDAs when a native editable subnet pattern fits Houdini better.

## Camera Controls Validation

Native Camera controls are stable only for the first exposed MoonRay attrs:

- `moonray:mb_shutter_bias`
- `moonray:bokeh`
- `moonray:bokeh_sides`
- `moonray:bokeh_image`
- `moonray:bokeh_angle`
- `moonray:bokeh_weight_location`
- `moonray:bokeh_weight_strength`

For camera UI work:

1. Check native MoonRay camera metadata, such as
   `coredata/PerspectiveCamera.json` and `coredata/OrthographicCamera.json`.
2. Check `Camera.cc` for existing standard USD camera mapping and generic
   `moonray:*` pass-through.
3. Confirm the selected attrs are copied to `primaryCamera` if the active render
   path uses `primaryCamera`.
4. Identify the correct Camera LOP renderer DS file. With the current
   `pythonrc.py` hook, Camera LOP Moonray properties resolve to
   `soho/parameters/moonray_Camera.ds`.
5. Validate with the normal installed H20.5 package path:
   `hou.findFile("soho/parameters/moonray_Camera.ds")` should resolve under
   `/Applications/MoonRay/installs/openmoonray/plugin/houdini`.
6. Create a fresh Camera LOP after install sync and confirm the Moonray folder
   and controls are visible.
7. Export default USD and confirm no `moonray:*` camera attrs are authored.
8. Explicitly set the controls and confirm the expected custom USD attrs.
9. Dump RDLA/RDL and confirm `PerspectiveCamera("primaryCamera")` receives
   `mb_shutter_bias`, `dof`, `dof_aperture`, `dof_focus_distance`, and the
   bokeh attrs when USD DOF is enabled.

DOF dependency:

- Bokeh controls require standard USD DOF, usually `fStop` plus
  `focusDistance`, to affect `primaryCamera` and the render visibly.
- With DOF off, bokeh attrs may exist on the authored camera object but are not
  copied to `primaryCamera`; do not present them as visibly effective in that
  state.

Deferred camera work:

- `moonray:class` validation against `INTERFACE_CAMERA`.
- FisheyeCamera, SphericalCamera, DomeMaster3DCamera, and BakeCamera.
- Stereo controls.
- `pixel_sample_map`.
- Medium/material/projector/bake camera workflows.

## Render Settings Validation

Track A / Track B rule for current Render Settings work:

- Track A is DCC/UI/USD-contract work. It may change the custom Render Settings LOP generator, regenerated HDA, validation scripts, docs, and installed/runtime source alignment.
- Track B is backend forensic work. It may inspect or temporarily instrument `RenderBuffer.cc`, `ArrasRenderer.cc`, `RenderPass.cc`, `RenderDelegate.cc`, `UsdRenderers.json`, Beauty/AOV binding lifecycle, render settings dirtying/versioning, and viewport/IPR refresh behavior.
- Track A and Track B may run in parallel when UI/USD authoring and backend runtime behavior are coupled.
- Parallel work is allowed. Unsupported blending is not.
- Keep DCC/USD evidence separate from backend/runtime evidence in reports.
- Prefer separate commits for DCC cleanup/docs and backend fixes.
- Do not mix Track A cleanup and Track B backend behavior changes in one commit unless the backend root cause is proven, the fix is narrow, and the diff explains why UI/USD and backend behavior must change together.
- Backend files are not out of scope, but behavioral backend changes require evidence before implementation: source-path proof, exported USD proof, log proof, and render/EXR or runtime symptom proof.
- Do not flip `aovsupport`, restart `cameraDepth`, or broaden non-beauty AOV transport without targeted proof.

Render Settings LOP is partial/WIP. Use this workflow before declaring any part stable:

1. Confirm the generation script is source of truth.
2. Regenerate the HDA.
3. Confirm the HDA loads in H20.5.
4. Confirm no manual HDA-only drift.
5. Export USDA and inspect:
   - RenderSettings prim.
   - RenderProduct prim.
   - RenderVar prims.
   - camera relationship.
   - products relationship.
   - orderedVars relationship.
   - resolution.
   - productName.
   - `moonray:sceneVariable:*` attrs.
6. Render via direct husk or USD Render ROP.
7. Confirm output path and resolution.
8. For the custom MoonRay Render Settings LOP default, confirm `aov_beauty=1`, `RenderProduct` exists, `productName` exists, `productType = "raster"`, Beauty RenderVar exists, and `orderedVars` targets the Beauty RenderVar.
9. For the diagnostic no-Beauty path, confirm `aov_beauty=0` removes the Beauty RenderVar and leaves `orderedVars` empty; do not treat this as the H20.5 disk-output production default unless render proof changes.
10. For generic Houdini Render Settings, do not claim functional MoonRay rendering from the MoonRay folder alone. The folder is UI integration evidence only. Export flattened USDA and confirm whether `products` has targets and whether `RenderProduct`, `productName`, `productType`, and `orderedVars` exist. If the flattened USDA has empty `rel products` and no RenderProduct/productName/productType, generic Render Settings alone is not a complete MoonRay output setup.
11. For viewport/IPR behavior, record fresh H20.5 UI proof separately from Hython/export proof.
12. For USD Render ROP/husk behavior, require output path proof and image/EXR proof before calling the render path filled or production-working.

Do not validate viewport/IPR resolution with offline RenderSettings assumptions. Viewport/IPR framing is viewport-driven unless a supported Houdini/Hydra mechanism proves otherwise.

Normal custom-LOP disk output currently defaults to an authored Beauty RenderVar because H20.5 production `husk` rejected the empty-`orderedVars` custom product and the Beauty RenderVar path produced filled EXRs. This evidence is scoped to beauty. Do not promote non-beauty AOVs without production Arras/H20.5 filled EXR proof.

## OCIO / Color Management Validation

Color-management claims require value proof, not just metadata proof.

Current implemented scope:

- `RenderSettings.renderingColorSpace` is implemented for authored typed color
  values that pass through materials, lights, light filters, and generic
  RGB/RGBA `ValueConverter` paths.
- Constant-color tests for no color space, Linear Rec.709, ACEScg, and Linear
  Rec.2020 must prove that generated RDLA values differ when the requested
  renderer working space differs.
- OIIO/EXR metadata or `husk` output behavior alone is still not proof that
  MoonRay rendered internally in the named color space.

When validating color behavior, record all of these separately:

1. Authored USD `RenderSettings.renderingColorSpace`.
2. Authored USD texture metadata such as `UsdUVTexture.sourceColorSpace` and any
   MaterialX color-space attributes.
3. Generated RDLA/RDL material and map nodes, including `UsdUVTexture`,
   `ImageMap`, texture file path, `sourceColorSpace`, and `gamma`.
4. Production `husk` EXR sampled pixel values.
5. EXR metadata from `oiiotool --info -v`.
6. Viewport/IPR display behavior, separately from disk EXR values.

Use TX textures for production texture color probes. Current texture source
interpretation is OCIO-driven: `auto` uses active config file rules, explicit
tokens resolve through the active config, and `raw` / `data` bypass source
conversion. Direct PNG/JPG/BMP and non-tiled source files can render or fail in
ways that are not clean production texture-color probes for hdMoonray. Texture
destination gamut conversion into ACEScg, Linear Rec.2020, or other non-native
renderer working spaces must be proven with generated RDLA/RDL and sampled
pixels.

MaterialX image color-space behavior remains `UNKNOWN` until a concrete
MaterialX image network is exported to USD, converted to RDLA, rendered, and
measured.

Do not broaden OCIO support without separate proof for:

- USD color constants beyond the currently proven material/light/light-filter
  typed color paths.
- `UsdUVTexture.sourceColorSpace` destination working-space conversion.
- MaterialX image color spaces.
- Output EXR pixels and metadata.
- Viewport/IPR display.

## AOV Validation

AOVs require the strictest validation.

An AOV is not production-working unless:

- USD RenderVar authoring is correct.
- RenderProduct `orderedVars` contains the RenderVar.
- hdMoonray creates the corresponding render buffer and MoonRay RenderOutput.
- RDLA declares the expected RenderOutput.
- Production H20.5 render writes the EXR channel/subimage.
- EXR stats prove nonzero/nonconstant plausible data.

Do not promote an AOV based only on:

- EXR metadata.
- Channel names.
- Authored RenderVars.
- Debug renderer success.
- RDLA RenderOutput declaration.
- Local PackTiles probes.

Known AOV repair evidence:

- `cameraDepth` was a useful diagnostic path, but not the preferred product-facing first AOV name.
- Native `alpha`, `depth`, `cameraDepth`, `Z`, `N`, `Ng`, `P`, `Wp`, `St`, and `weight` are mapped and declared, and the debug renderer produces meaningful payloads or expected constant payloads.
- The first production zero-fill failure was proven in Apple Silicon half-packet conversion: mcrt had finite AOV values before encode, but H16 packets decoded as zero.
- `scene_rdl2::grid_util::PackTiles` now uses scalar `__fp16` plus `std::memcpy` on ARM, and production H20.5 `HdMoonrayRendererPlugin` writes filled EXRs for the explicit single-RenderVar native baseline.
- `weight` can be constant nonzero in the simple fixture; classify expected constants separately from zero-filled failures.
- Future AOV work should focus on product semantics, multi-AOV products, UI exposure, and untested families such as material AOVs, LPE/light AOVs, primitive attributes, visibility AOVs, Cryptomatte, and motion vectors.

## Unit / Scale Validation

Unit behavior now has a narrow global bridge. Do not mix further unit work into
unrelated feature work.

Known facts from `units-and-scale-notes.md`:

- Houdini Solaris defaults to `metersPerUnit = 1.0`.
- Houdini `unitlength` changes authored USD `metersPerUnit`.
- hdMoonRay reads/applies `metersPerUnit` only through
  `SceneVariables.scene_scale`.
- MoonRay `SceneVariables.scene_scale` default is `1.0`.
- `metersPerUnit = 1.0` may be default-elided in RDLA; `metersPerUnit = 0.01`
  and unauthored USD fallback should write `scene_scale = 0.01`.
- Explicit `moonray:sceneVariable:scene_scale` must win over automatic stage
  metadata.
- Raw light radii, RectLight width/height, SpotLight lens radius, and
  SSS/material distance attrs are passed raw.
- Houdini `nonrayscene_scale` / Apply Scene Scale for normalized lights remains unresolved.

Future unit work must use controlled fixtures and compare Houdini/Karma
expectations against hdMoonRay/MoonRay behavior.
